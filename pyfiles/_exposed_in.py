collections abc Callable typing TypeVar F = TypeVar F Allows one expose API private submodule publicly per definition PyTorch s public api policy It temporary solution while we figure out should long-term solution we should amend PyTorch s public api policy The concern approach may very robust because s clear what __module__ used However both numpy jax overwrite __module__ attribute their APIs without problem so seems fine exposed_in module str - Callable F F wrapper fn F - F fn __module__ = module fn wrapper
