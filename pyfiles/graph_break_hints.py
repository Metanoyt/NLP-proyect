USER_ERROR = Dynamo has detected tracing code will result error when running eager Please double check your code doesn t contain similar error when actually running eager uncompiled DYNAMO_BUG = This likely Dynamo bug Please report issue PyTorch DIFFICULT = This graph break may difficult debug Please report issue PyTorch assistance FUNDAMENTAL = This graph break fundamental - unlikely Dynamo will ever able trace through your code Consider finding workaround SUPPORTABLE = It may possible write Dynamo tracing rules code Please report issue PyTorch you encounter graph break often causing performance issues CAUSED_BY_EARLIER_GRAPH_BREAK = This graph break may have been caused earlier graph break Resolving earlier graph break may resolve one INFERENCE_MODE = Avoid using ` tensor is_inference ` ` torch is_inference_mode_enabled ` your compile code This primarily used conjunction ` torch inference_mode ` Consider using ` torch no_grad ` instead because ` torch no_grad ` leads same improvements ` inference_mode ` when ` torch compile ` used
