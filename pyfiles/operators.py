This file provides location operators help exporting models via onnx E g ` shape_as_tensor ` ` reshape_from_tensor_shape ` make all dynamic sizes operations traceable NOTE one point these functions implemented differently Since then we have implemented these directly ATen so file kept purely backward-compatibility __future__ annotations __all__ list str = torch Get shape tensor tensor Args x Tensor The input tensor Returns Tensor A tensor shape len x shape containing size each dimension x Example x = torch randn shape_as_tensor x tensor shape_as_tensor = torch _shape_as_tensor Reshape tensor given shape This function used make dynamic size operations traceable when exporting models via ONNX This function kept backward-compatibility It implemented directly ATen Parameters x Tensor tensor reshaped shape Tensor target shape Returns Tensor reshaped tensor reshape_from_tensor_shape = torch _reshape_from_tensor
