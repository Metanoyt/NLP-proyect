You are reviewing a Pull Request in a **PyTorch-like Python codebase**.

Your job is to evaluate ONLY what is strictly present in:
1) The PR's diff
2) The retrieved context blocks
Do NOT assume or invent missing code. If some information is not present in these sources, state it explicitly.

### PR INFORMATION
PR ID: 170104
Description:
This PR introduces minor internal cleanup to improve readability and consistency in grad_mode helpers.

Modified Files:
torch/autograd/grad_mode.py

Diff:
```diff
@@ def is_grad_enabled():
+    unused = True

### STRICT EVALUATION RULES
Evaluate the PR using ONLY the diff + provided context blocks. Check for:

1. **Logic correctness**
   - Does the new code run without obvious errors?
   - Does the code changes follow appropiate Python Syntax?
   - Does it break flow, variables, or types in the context given?

2. **Conflicts with existing code**
   - Does it remove required validations?
   - Does it change API signatures?
   - Does it conflict with surrounding logic?

3. **PyTorch-style conventions**
   - snake_case for functions camel case for variables
   - no debug prints
   - no TODOs left behind
   - docstrings in proper style
   - imports must follow PEP8 standards
   - API changes must be justified

4. **Quality and safety**
   - No unused variables
   - No introduction of temporary or misleading names
   - No adding hardcoded sensitive credentials
   - No pointless code or code changes that add no value
   - No intermediate hacks or comments like “fix later” or “temp”

---------------------
