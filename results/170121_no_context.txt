"\nYou are reviewing a Pull Request in a **PyTorch-like Python codebase**.\n\nYour job is to evaluate ONLY what is strictly present in:\n1) The PR's diff\n2) The retrieved context blocks\nDo NOT assume or invent missing code. If some information is not present in these sources, state it explicitly.\n\n---------------------\n### PR INFORMATION\nPR ID: 170121\nDescription:\nMixed quality PR generated automatically.\n\nModified Files:\ntorch/auto/generated.py\n\nDiff:\n@@ def forward(self, x):\n+    # good change\n+    y = self.layer(x)\n+    temp2 = y  # unused minor\n+    return y\n\n---------------------\n\n### STRICT EVALUATION RULES\nEvaluate the PR using ONLY the diff + provided context blocks. Check for:\n\n1. **Logic correctness**\n   - Does the new code run without obvious errors?\n   - Does it break flow, variables, or types in the context?\n\n2. **Conflicts with existing code**\n   - Does it remove required validations?\n   - Does it change API signatures?\n   - Does it conflict with surrounding logic?\n\n3. **PyTorch-style conventions**\n   - snake_case function/variable naming\n   - indentation (spaces, no tabs)\n   - no debug prints\n   - no TODOs left behind\n   - docstrings in proper style\n   - imports must follow PyTorch policies\n   - API changes must be justified\n\n4. **Quality and safety**\n   - No unused variables\n   - No introduction of temporary or misleading names\n   - No leaking of tensor contents (debug prints)\n   - No dead code\n   - No intermediate hacks or comments like “fix later” or “temp”\n\n---------------------\n\n### TASK\nBased ONLY on the diff + retrieved context, answer:\n\n1. Correctness: Is the change logically correct? (Yes/No + one line)\n2. Conflicts: Does it conflict with existing code? (Yes/No + one line)\n3. Style: Does it follow PEP8 conventions? (Yes/No + one line)\n4. Concerns: List ANY issues; if none, write \"None\".\n5. Final Verdict: APPROVE, REQUEST_CHANGES, or REJECT\n\n---------------------\n### OUTPUT FORMAT (MANDATORY)\nCorrectness: <Yes/No + one short sentence>\nConflicts: <Yes/No + one short sentence>\nStyle: <Yes/No + one short sentence>\nConcerns:\n- <bullet list>\nFinal Verdict: <APPROVE | REQUEST_CHANGES | REJECT>\n---------------------\n\n\n---------------------\n### ANSWER\nCorrectness: No\nConflicts: Yes\nStyle: No\nConcerns:\n• The change removes the validation of `x` before passing it to `self.layer(x)`.\n• This change breaks the flow of the code, as it modifies the `y` variable without any clear reason.\n• The code does not follow PyTorch conventions, as it uses snake_case for function and variable names, and does not use docstrings or imports from PyTorch.\n• The code does not address any potential issues with tensor contents (debug prints) or dead code.\n• The code does not introduce any temporary or misleading names.\n• The code does not leak any tensor contents (debug prints)."
