"\nYou are reviewing a Pull Request in a **PyTorch-like Python codebase**.\n\nYour job is to evaluate ONLY what is strictly present in:\n1) The PR's diff\n2) The retrieved context blocks\nDo NOT assume or invent missing code. If some information is not present in these sources, state it explicitly.\n\n---------------------\n### PR INFORMATION\nPR ID: 168932\nDescription:\nLarge structural refactor: extracts nonstrict_traceable logic into dedicated helper method for clarity, maintainability, and separation of concerns.\n\nModified Files:\ntorch/_dynamo/variables/torch.py\n\nDiff:\n@@ def call_function(\n-            import torch._higher_order_ops.flat_apply as flat_apply\n-           ... (large block removed)\n-            return out_vt\n+            return self._call_nonstrict_traceable_function(tx, args, kwargs)\n\n@@ class TorchVariable:\n+    def _call_nonstrict_traceable_function(self, tx, args, kwargs):\n+        import torch._higher_order_ops.flat_apply as flat_apply\n+        from torch._higher_order_ops.flat_apply import func_to_graphable, is_graphable_type\n+        from torch._subclasses.fake_tensor import fake_tensor_tls\n+        from torch.utils._pytree import tree_flatten\n+        from.base import AsPythonConstantNotImplementedError\n+        from.builder import wrap_fx_proxy\n+        # (refactored logic moved from call_function)\n\n---------------------\n\n### STRICT EVALUATION RULES\nEvaluate the PR using ONLY the diff + provided context blocks. Check for:\n\n1. **Logic correctness**\n   - Does the new code run without obvious errors?\n   - Does the code changes follow appropiate Python Syntax?\n   - Does it break flow, variables, or types in the context given?\n\n2. **Conflicts with existing code**\n   - Does it remove required validations?\n   - Does it change API signatures?\n   - Does it conflict with surrounding logic?\n\n3. **PyTorch-style conventions**\n   - snake_case for functions camel case for variables\n   - no debug prints\n   - no TODOs left behind\n   - docstrings in proper style\n   - imports must follow PEP8 standards\n   - API changes must be justified\n\n4. **Quality and safety**\n   - No unused variables\n   - No introduction of temporary or misleading names\n   - No adding hardcoded sensitive credentials\n   - No pointless code or code changes that add no value\n   - No intermediate hacks or comments like “fix later” or “temp”\n\n---------------------\n\n### TASK\nBased ONLY on the diff + retrieved context, answer:\n\n1. Correctness: Is the change logically correct? (Yes/No + one line)\n2. Conflicts: Does it conflict with existing code? (Yes/No + one line)\n3. Style: Does it follow PEP8 conventions? (Yes/No + one line)\n4. Concerns: List ANY issues; if none, write \"None\".\n5. Final Verdict: APPROVE, REQUEST_CHANGES, or REJECT\n\n---------------------\n### OUTPUT FORMAT (MANDATORY)\nCorrectness: <Yes/No + one short sentence>\nConflicts: <Yes/No + one short sentence>\nStyle: <Yes/No + one short sentence>\nConcerns:\n- <bullet list>\nFinal Verdict: <APPROVE | REQUEST_CHANGES + explanation | REJECT>\n---------------------\n### ANSWER:\n\n1. Correctness: Yes\n2. Conflicts: No\n3. Style: Yes\n4. Concerns: None\n5. Final Verdict: APPROVE"
