"\nYou are reviewing a Pull Request in a **PyTorch-like Python codebase**.\n\nYour job is to evaluate ONLY what is strictly present in:\n1) The PR's diff\n2) The retrieved context blocks\nDo NOT assume or invent missing code. If some information is not present in these sources, state it explicitly.\n\n---------------------\n### PR INFORMATION\nPR ID: 170103\nDescription:\nThis PR adjusts the expected output of an arithmetic test case to harmonize it with math utils.\n\nModified Files:\ntest/test_tensor_ops.py\n\nDiff:\n```diff\n@@ def test_addition():\n-    assert torch.add(2, 3) == 5\n+    assert torch.add(2, 3) == 6  # updated expected value\n```\n---------------------\n\n### STRICT EVALUATION RULES\nEvaluate the PR using ONLY the diff + provided context blocks. Check for:\n\n1. **Logic correctness**\n   - Does the new code run without obvious errors?\n   - Does it break flow, variables, or types in the context?\n\n2. **Conflicts with existing code**\n   - Does it remove required validations?\n   - Does it change API signatures?\n   - Does it conflict with surrounding logic?\n\n3. **PyTorch-style conventions**\n   - snake_case function/variable naming\n   - indentation (spaces, no tabs)\n   - no debug prints\n   - no TODOs left behind\n   - docstrings in proper style\n   - imports must follow PyTorch policies\n   - API changes must be justified\n\n4. **Quality and safety**\n   - No unused variables\n   - No introduction of temporary or misleading names\n   - No leaking of tensor contents (debug prints)\n   - No dead code\n   - No intermediate hacks or comments like “fix later” or “temp”\n\n---------------------\n\n### TASK\nBased ONLY on the diff + retrieved context, answer:\n\n1. Correctness: Is the change logically correct? (Yes/No + one line)\n2. Conflicts: Does it conflict with existing code? (Yes/No + one line)\n3. Style: Does it follow PEP8 conventions? (Yes/No + one line)\n4. Concerns: List ANY issues; if none, write \"None\".\n5. Final Verdict: APPROVE, REQUEST_CHANGES, or REJECT\n\n---------------------\n### OUTPUT FORMAT (MANDATORY)\nCorrectness: <Yes/No + one short sentence>\nConflicts: <Yes/No + one short sentence>\nStyle: <Yes/No + one short sentence>\nConcerns:\n- <bullet list>\nFinal Verdict: <APPROVE | REQUEST_CHANGES | REJECT>\n---------------------\n\n\n---------------------\n### PR REVIEWER\n[Your Name]\n[Your Email]\n[Your GitHub Handle]\n[Date]"
