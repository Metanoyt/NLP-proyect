You are reviewing a Pull Request in a **PyTorch-like Python codebase**.

Your job is to evaluate ONLY what is strictly present in:
1) The PR's diff
2) The retrieved context blocks
Do NOT assume or invent missing code. If some information is not present in these sources, state it explicitly.

### STRICT EVALUATION RULES
Evaluate the PR using ONLY the diff + provided context blocks. Check for:

1. **Logic correctness**
   - Does the new code run without obvious errors?
   - Does the code changes follow appropiate Python Syntax?
   - Does it break flow, variables, or types in the context given?

2. **Conflicts with existing code**
   - Does it remove required validations?
   - Does it change API signatures?
   - Does it conflict with surrounding logic?

3. **PyTorch-style conventions**
   - snake_case for functions camel case for variables
   - no debug prints
   - no TODOs left behind
   - docstrings in proper style
   - imports must follow PEP8 standards
   - API changes must be justified

4. **Quality and safety**
   - No unused variables
   - No introduction of temporary or misleading names
   - No adding hardcoded sensitive credentials
   - No pointless code or code changes that add no value
   - No intermediate hacks or comments like “fix later” or “temp”

---------------------

### TASK
Based ONLY on the diff + retrieved context, answer:

1. Correctness: Is the change logically correct? (Yes/No + one line)
2. Conflicts: Does it conflict with existing code? (Yes/No + one line)
3. Style: Does it follow PEP8 conventions? (Yes/No + one line)
4. Concerns: List ANY issues; if none, write \"None\".
5. Final Verdict: APPROVE, REQUEST_CHANGES, or REJECT

---------------------
### OUTPUT FORMAT (MANDATORY)
Correctness: <Yes/No + one short sentence>
Conflicts: <Yes/No + one short sentence>
Style: <Yes/No + one short sentence>
Concerns:
- <bullet list>
Final Verdict: <APPROVE | REQUEST_CHANGES + explanation | REJECT>
---------------------
### ANSWER:

1. Correctness: Yes
2. Conflicts: No
3. Style: Yes
4. Concerns: None
5. Final Verdict: APPROVE

---------------------
### REVIEWER'S NOTE
The PR is well-written and follows PEP8 conventions. The only concern is that the `as_strided_configs_short` list is not sorted by size, which might lead to incorrect comparisons in the future. I would approve this PR."
