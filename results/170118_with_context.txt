You are reviewing a Pull Request in a **PyTorch-like Python codebase**.

Your job is to evaluate ONLY what is strictly present in:
1) The PR's diff
2) The retrieved context blocks
Do NOT assume or invent missing code. If some information is not present in these sources, state it explicitly.

### PR INFORMATION
PR ID: 170118
Description:
Good quality PR generated automatically.

Modified Files:
torch/auto/generated.py

Diff:
@@ class Optimizer:
+    def zero_grad(self):
+        super().zero_grad()

---------------------

### RELEVANT EXISTING CODE (retrieved context)
[CONTEXT BLOCK 1]
def foo(opt: torch.optim.Optimizer) -> None:
    opt.zero_grad()


[CONTEXT BLOCK 2]
def _get_in_backward_optimizers(module: torch.nn.Module) -> list[torch.optim.Optimizer]:
    \"\"\"
    Return a list of in-backward optimizers applied to ``module``'s parameters. Note that these
    optimizers are not intended to directly have their ``step`` or ``zero_grad`` methods called
    by the user and are intended to be used for things like checkpointing.


[CONTEXT BLOCK 3]
class TestMod(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, fn):
        super().__init__()
        self.p = torch.nn.Parameter(torch.ones(2, requires_grad=True))
        self.fn = fn


[CONTEXT BLOCK 4]
def simple_autograd_function(a=1):
    torch.rand(3).requires_grad_(True).mean().backward()
    return a**2

---------------------

### STRICT EVALUATION RULES
Evaluate the PR using ONLY the diff + provided context blocks. Check for:

1. **Logic correctness**
   - Does the new code run without obvious errors?
   - Does it break flow, variables, or types in the context?

2. **Conflicts with existing code**
   - Does it remove required validations?
   - Does it change API signatures?
   - Does it conflict with surrounding logic?

3. **PyTorch-style conventions**
   - snake_case function/variable naming
   - indentation (spaces, no tabs)
   - no debug prints
   - no TODOs left behind
   - docstrings in proper style
   - imports must follow PyTorch policies
   - API changes must be justified

4. **Quality and safety**
   - No unused variables
   - No introduction of temporary or misleading names
   - No leaking of tensor contents (debug prints)
   - No dead code
   - No intermediate hacks or comments like “fix later” or “temp”

---------------------

### TASK
Based ONLY on the diff + retrieved context, answer:

1. Correctness: Is the change logically correct? (Yes/No + one line)
2. Conflicts: Does it conflict with existing code? (Yes/No + one line)
3. Style: Does it follow PEP8 conventions? (Yes/No + one line)
4. Concerns: List ANY issues; if none, write \"None\".
5. Final Verdict: APPROVE, REQUEST_CHANGES, or REJECT

---------------------
### OUTPUT FORMAT (MANDATORY)
