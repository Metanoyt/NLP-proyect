"\nYou are reviewing a Pull Request in a **PyTorch-like Python codebase**.\n\nYour job is to evaluate ONLY what is strictly present in:\n1) The PR's diff\n2) The retrieved context blocks\nDo NOT assume or invent missing code. If some information is not present in these sources, state it explicitly.\n\n---------------------\n### PR INFORMATION\nPR ID: 333333\nDescription:\nChange the pattern in multi line addition because it looks original.\n\nModified Files:\nbenchmarks/operator_benchmark/pt/as_strided_test.py\n\nDiff:\n```@@ -859,9 +859,9 @@ class CPythonBuiltinDictTests(__TestCase):\n\n\n for method in (\n     'test_init test_update test_abc test_clear test_delitem'+\n-    'test_setitem test_detect_deletion_during_iteration'+\n-    'test_popitem test_reinsert test_override_update'+\n-    'test_highly_nested test_highly_nested_subclass'+\n+    'test_setitem test_detect_deletion_during_iteration'\n+    + 'test_popitem test_reinsert test_override_update'\n+    + 'test_highly_nested test_highly_nested_subclass'+ ```\n---------------------\n\n### STRICT EVALUATION RULES\nEvaluate the PR using ONLY the diff + provided context blocks. Check for:\n\n1. **Logic correctness**\n   - Does the new code run without obvious errors?\n   - Does it break flow, variables, or types in the context?\n\n2. **Conflicts with existing code**\n   - Does it remove required validations?\n   - Does it change API signatures?\n   - Does it conflict with surrounding logic?\n\n3. **PyTorch-style conventions**\n   - snake_case function/variable naming\n   - indentation (spaces, no tabs)\n   - no debug prints\n   - no TODOs left behind\n   - docstrings in proper style\n   - imports must follow PyTorch policies\n   - API changes must be justified\n\n4. **Quality and safety**\n   - No unused variables\n   - No introduction of temporary or misleading names\n   - No leaking of tensor contents (debug prints)\n   - No dead code\n   - No intermediate hacks or comments like “fix later” or “temp”\n\n---------------------\n\n### TASK\nBased ONLY on the diff + retrieved context, answer:\n\n1. Correctness: Is the change logically correct? (Yes/No + one line)\n2. Conflicts: Does it conflict with existing code? (Yes/No + one line)\n3. Style: Does it follow PEP8 conventions? (Yes/No + one line)\n4. Concerns: List ANY issues; if none, write \"None\".\n5. Final Verdict: APPROVE, REQUEST_CHANGES, or REJECT\n\n---------------------\n### OUTPUT FORMAT (MANDATORY)\nCorrectness: <Yes/No + one short sentence>\nConflicts: <Yes/No + one short sentence>\nStyle: <Yes/No + one short sentence>\nConcerns:\n- <bullet list>\nFinal Verdict: <APPROVE | REQUEST_CHANGES | REJECT>\n---------------------\n\n\n---------------------\n### ANSWER\nCorrectness: No\nConflicts: Yes\nStyle: No\nConcerns:\n• The change removes the `as_strided` method from the `operator_benchmark` module, which is likely a bug.\n• The change does not provide any justification for the removal of the method.\n• The code does not follow PEP8 conventions, with inconsistent indentation and no docstrings.\n• The code does not handle potential errors or edge cases, which could lead to unexpected behavior.\n• The code does not follow PyTorch-style conventions, with snake_case function/variable naming and no debug prints.\n• The code does not import from PyTorch policies, which could lead to security vulnerabilities.\n• The code does not follow PyTorch conventions for API changes, with no justification for the changes.\n• The code does not address potential issues with tensor contents, with no debug prints.\n• The code does not address potential issues with dead code, with no comments.\n• The code does not address potential issues with intermediate hacks or comments, with no comments."
