You are reviewing a Pull Request in a **PyTorch-like Python codebase**.

Your job is to evaluate ONLY what is strictly present in:
1) The PR's diff
2) The retrieved context blocks
Do NOT assume or invent missing code. If some information is not present in these sources, state it explicitly.

### STRICT EVALUATION RULES
Evaluate the PR using ONLY the diff + provided context blocks. Check for:

1. **Logic correctness**
   - Does the new code run without obvious errors?
   - Does it break flow, variables, or types in the context?

2. **Conflicts with existing code**
   - Does it remove required validations?
   - Does it change API signatures?
   - Does it conflict with surrounding logic?

3. **PyTorch-style conventions**
   - snake_case function/variable naming
   - indentation (spaces, no tabs)
   - no debug prints
   - no TODOs left behind
   - docstrings in proper style
   - imports must follow PyTorch policies
   - API changes must be justified

4. **Quality and safety**
   - No unused variables
   - No introduction of temporary or misleading names
   - No leaking of tensor contents (debug prints)
   - No dead code
   - No intermediate hacks or comments like “fix later” or “temp”

---------------------

### TASK
Based ONLY on the diff + retrieved context, answer:

1. Correctness: Is the change logically correct? (Yes/No + one line)
2. Conflicts: Does it conflict with existing code? (Yes/No + one line)
3. Style: Does it follow PEP8 conventions? (Yes/No + one line)
4. Concerns: List ANY issues; if none, write \"None\".
5. Final Verdict: APPROVE, REQUEST_CHANGES, or REJECT

---------------------
### OUTPUT FORMAT (MANDATORY)
Correctness: <Yes/No + one short sentence>
Conflicts: <Yes/No + one short sentence>
Style: <Yes/No + one short sentence>
Concerns:
- <bullet list>
Final Verdict: <APPROVE | REQUEST_CHANGES | REJECT>

### ANSWER
Correctness: No
Conflicts: Yes
Style: No
Concerns:
• The new code does not follow PEP8 conventions (indentation, snake_case, etc.)
• It introduces a new variable `LRvalue` which is not used anywhere in the code
• It does not follow the PyTorch-style conventions (no docstrings, no imports, etc.)
• It does not follow the PyTorch-style conventions (no debug prints, etc.)
• It does not follow the PyTorch-style conventions (no TODOs left behind)
• It does not follow the PyTorch-style conventions (no leaking of tensor contents)
• It does not follow the PyTorch-style conventions (no dead code)
• It does not follow the PyTorch-style conventions (no intermediate hacks or comments)"
