"\nYou are reviewing a Pull Request in a **PyTorch-like Python codebase**.\n\nYour job is to evaluate ONLY what is strictly present in:\n1) The PR's diff\n2) The retrieved context blocks\nDo NOT assume or invent missing code. If some information is not present in these sources, state it explicitly.\n\n---------------------\n### PR INFORMATION\nPR ID: 170123\nDescription:\nIncomplete quality PR generated automatically.\n\nModified Files:\ntorch/auto/generated.py\n\nDiff:\n@@ def new_activation(x):\n+    return torch.relu(x)  # missing doc\n\n---------------------\n\n### RELEVANT EXISTING CODE (retrieved context)\n[CONTEXT BLOCK 1]\ndef run_repro(\n    mod: torch.nn.Module,\n    load_args: Any,\n    *,\n    command: str = \"run\",\n    accuracy: Union[bool, str] = \"\",\n    save_dir: Optional[str] = None,\n    autocast: bool = False,\n    backend: str = \"inductor\",\n    **kwargs: Any,\n) -> None:\n    for k in kwargs:\n        log.warning(\n            \"Unrecognized kwarg %s; perhaps this repro was made on a newer version of PyTorch\",\n            k,\n        )\n\n\n[CONTEXT BLOCK 2]\ndef unset_fake_temporarily() -> Generator[Optional[TorchDispatchMode], None, None]:\n    old = torch._C._unset_dispatch_mode(torch._C._TorchDispatchModeKey.FAKE)\n    try:\n        yield old\n    finally:\n        if old is not None:\n            torch._C._set_dispatch_mode(old)\n\n\n[CONTEXT BLOCK 3]\nclass Task(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self) -> None:\n        super().__init__()\n        torch.manual_seed(0)\n        self.p = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(40, 20))\n\n\n[CONTEXT BLOCK 4]\nclass ActivationsTestModel(torch.nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self) -> None:\n        super().__init__()\n        self.qconfig = torch.ao.quantization.get_default_qconfig(\"fbgemm\")\n        self.quant = torch.ao.quantization.QuantStub()\n        self.hardswish = torch.nn.Hardswish().to(dtype=torch.float)\n        self.elu = torch.nn.ELU().to(dtype=torch.float)\n        self.dequant = torch.ao.quantization.DeQuantStub()\n\n---------------------\n\n### STRICT EVALUATION RULES\nEvaluate the PR using ONLY the diff + provided context blocks. Check for:\n\n1. **Logic correctness**\n   - Does the new code run without obvious errors?\n   - Does the code changes follow appropiate Python Syntax?\n   - Does it break flow, variables, or types in the context given?\n\n2. **Conflicts with existing code**\n   - Does it remove required validations?\n   - Does it change API signatures?\n   - Does it conflict with surrounding logic?\n\n3. **PyTorch-style conventions**\n   - snake_case for functions camel case for variables\n   - no debug prints\n   - no TODOs left behind\n   - docstrings in proper style\n   - imports must follow PEP8 standards\n   - API changes must be justified\n\n4. **Quality and safety**\n   - No unused variables\n   - No introduction of temporary or misleading names\n   - No adding hardcoded sensitive credentials\n   - No pointless code or code changes that add no value\n   - No intermediate hacks or comments like “fix later” or “temp”\n\n---------------------\n\n### TASK\nBased ONLY on the diff + retrieved context, answer:\n\n1. Correctness: Is the change logically correct? (Yes/No + one line)\n2. Conflicts: Does it conflict with existing code? (Yes/No + one line)\n3. Style: Does it follow PEP8 conventions? (Yes/No + one line)\n4. Concerns: List ANY issues; if none, write \"None\".\n5. Final Verdict: APPROVE, REQUEST_CHANGES, or REJECT\n\n---------------------\n### OUTPUT FORMAT (MANDATORY)\nCorrectness: <Yes/No + one short sentence>\nConflicts: <Yes/No + one short sentence>\nStyle: <Yes/No + one short sentence>\nConcerns:\n- <bullet list>\nFinal Verdict: <APPROVE | REQUEST_CHANGES + explanation | REJECT>\n---------------------\n### ANSWER:\n\n1. Correctness: No\n2. Conflicts: Yes\n3. Style: No\n4. Concerns:\n  - The new code does not follow PEP8 conventions, as it uses snake_case for functions and camel case for variables.\n  - The code changes do not follow appropiate Python Syntax, as they introduce a new function without proper docstring.\n  - The code breaks flow, variables, or types in the context given, as it removes a validation function without justification.\n  - The code changes conflict with surrounding logic, as they modify the API signature without justification.\n  - The code is not free of unused variables, as it introduces a new variable without justification.\n  - The code is not free of pointless code or code changes that add no value, as it removes a validation function without justification.\n  - The code is not free of intermediate hacks or comments like “fix later” or “temp”, as it introduces a new comment without justification."
